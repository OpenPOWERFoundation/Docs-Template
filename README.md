# OpenPOWER Foundation Documentation Development Guide
This repository holds the source for the *Documentation Development Guide*
(formerly *Master Template Document*) for 
OpenPOWER Foundation. The PDF and HTML generated from the ``doc_dev_guide``
directory build a document that both describes how to build a new
document and contains examples and directions on how to do it.

To build this project, one must ensure that the Docs-Master project has
also been cloned at the same directory level as the Docs-Template project.
This can be accomplished with the following steps:

1. Clone the master documentation project (Docs-Master) using the following command:

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/OpenPOWERFoundation/Docs-Master.git
  ```
  
2. Clone this project (Docs-Template) using the following command:

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/OpenPOWERFoundation/Docs-Template.git
  ```
  
3. Build the project with these commands:
  ```
  $ cd Docs-Template
  $ mvn clean generate-sources
  ```

The online version of the document can be found in the OpenPOWER Foundation
Document library at [OpenPOWER Foundation Documentation Development Guide](http://openpowerfoundation.org/?resource_lib=openpower-foundation-documentation-development-guide).  

An introductory video on how to develop in the OpenPOWER Foundation
Docbook environment has been created and posted on YouTube.

The project which controls the look and feel of the document is the 
[Docs-Maven-Plugin project](https://github.com/OpenPOWERFoundation/Docs-Maven-Plugin), an 
OpenPOWER Foundation private project on GitHub.  To obtain access to the Maven Plugin project, 
contact Jeff Scheel \([scheel@us.ibm.com](mailto://scheel@us.ibm.com)\).

Additional sub-directories of interest in this project are:

- ``errata_template``: provide a template for errata documents
